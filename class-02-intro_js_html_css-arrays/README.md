# Class 2: Basics of JS and HTML, including Arrays; CSS Introduction

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 1, Tuesday Lecture

### Class Roadmap for Today

*Expect lecture to go to about 12:15-12:30 today, as it will most days. We'll take 2 breaks of 10ish minutes during that time, then you'll have the entire afternoon in lab.*

- Code review with Nicholas *[20 minutes]*
- [Topics from HTML readings](#html) *[20 minutes]*
- [Topics from CSS readings](#css) *[20 minutes]*
- *10 minute break*
- [Topics from JS readings](#js) *[45 minutes]*
- *10 minute break*
- [Learning Journal + Career Coaching assignments](#lj) *[15 minutes]*
- [Review lab assignment, code demo, `git clone`](#code) *[45 minutes]*

#### Announcements:

- There will be lots of detail work today on JS and CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need minimal instruction on HTML except for concepts and overview of practices, and the specifics of how to interface with JS and CSS.

- **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like clarity about. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, we'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for meow. On this day in particular, where we have so much to cover, it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.

- The reasons for going over the JS and CSS chapters in so much detail this morning, even though they do overlap with the pre-work somewhat:
  1. Not everyone got the same amount of benefit/knowledge from completing pre-work.
  2. There are gaps, and omissions, and depth of the subject matter that need to be addressed.
  3. We're focusing on translating into "how we use this" and getting practice in applying this material within our new IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of VSCode, Chrome, Git, and the terminal.

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 2 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of the fundamental structures of HTML, including `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<script>`, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of assorted data types such as booleans, strings, integers, floats in JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of introductory CSS concepts and techniques from Chapter 10 of the textbook, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully manage a code project in the command line by using Git branches and by doing pushes and pulls to/from a repository on GitHub.

## Learning Journal + Career Coaching

We will look at the first learning journal assignment in Canvas together and explain the purpose of those assignments.

In addition, we will review two new career coaching assignments that are also in Canvas and will be published today.

## Live code

In our code demo today we'll be doing the following:

- Create a GitHub repo for our weekly project and `git clone` it
- Read through the lab assignment, translating it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
  1. Creating a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
