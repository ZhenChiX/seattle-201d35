**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Class 1 of Code 201, students will be able to:

- create a HTML page from scratch, with proper HTML5 hierarchical structure conventions, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- properly include a \<script> tag in an HTML document that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- write JavaScript that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- use the command line to create and change directories, create and list files, and open files in a text editor and in a web browser, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- install & use plugins for their text editor, including a minimap and a JavaScript linter, as measured by observations of the instructional staff

## Live code

This code demo is to help students be ready to complete the first assignment and also to show off some functionality of the REPL and Chrome Developer Tools. This demo should also reveal any lingering issues with student computer setups.
