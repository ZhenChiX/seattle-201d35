## Overview
This application was built for codefellows 201. It's problem is that we have a customer who wants a website built for his cookie business. "Pat's Cookies" aregoing to use a sample business from 5 'hypothetical' locations. At each location we must sample what it takes to provide a sample of the projected sales in the area using sample numbers given by Pat. Our goal is to design not only a website, but a working application alongside it to function for Pats business.
